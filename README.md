# makeup-arteenmi

It is one of my first projects in 2020.
A make up website one of my hobbies.
A young and a fresh website made with javascript for and audience that demands good photography and design.
The website has a carrousel, photo gallery using modal, a parallax effect in the contact form background and an embedded video.

--At that time I did not use to much GitHub and now when I prepared this for my new portfolio I realised all I improved. I am proud of myself.--
